# ADA2021_template
A template to follow for the organization of your Github repositories for your Directed Studies project, in partial fulfillment of your Applied Data Analysis in Marine Sciences course at Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. 

Use the elements of the outline provided here for whichever aspects are relevant to _your_ specific project. Depending on your experiments, you may (or may not) want to include everything, or you may want to add more (sub)directories; it is up to your discretion of what someone would need to reproduce your science, and what organization makes sense, based on your understanding of the principles of reproducible and open science.
